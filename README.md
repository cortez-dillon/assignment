Subject: Recommendation for Hedging a EUR 20,000,000 Receivable

This memo analyzes three hedging strategies (Forward, Money Market, and Put Option) for our upcoming EUR receivable and provides a final recommendation based on quantitative outcomes, risk profile, and strategic objectives.

---

### **A. Exposure Summary**

* **Exposure:** We hold a receivable of **EUR 20,000,000**.  
* **Timing:** The payment is due in **365 days (1 Year)**.  
* **Risk:** The company faces downside Foreign Exchange (FX) risk. Any depreciation in the EUR/USD spot rate over the next year will reduce the final USD value of the receivable, negatively impacting our budgeted cash flows.  
* **Current Rates (USD/EUR):** Spot: 1.1539 | Forward: 1.0935

### **B. Summary of Hedge Outcomes**

The three primary hedging strategies yield distinct outcomes for the final USD cash flow:

| Hedge Strategy | Certainty / Flexibility | Final USD Proceeds (Range) | Certain USD Proceed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Forward Contract** | High Certainty (Fixed) | $21,870,000 | **$21,870,000** |
| **Money Market (MM) Hedge** | High Certainty (Fixed) | $23,439,836 | **$23,439,836** |
| **Put Option** | High Flexibility (Floor/Upside) | $22,866,000 \- $25,188,000+ | $22,866,000 (Floor) |

#### **Key Insights:**

1. **Money Market Superiority:** The MM Hedge provides the highest **certain** USD cash flow ($23.44M). This outcome is driven by the significant negative deviation from the Interest Rate Parity check, indicating that **borrowing the low-rate EUR today and investing in the high-rate USD is highly beneficial.**  
2. **Option Value:** The Put Option provides a guaranteed minimum receipt of **$22.87M** (our 'floor'), which is substantially higher than the Forward rate's certain cash flow ($21.87M).

### **C. Sensitivity Interpretation**

The behavior of the hedges under various future spot rates ($S\\\_T$) reveals their inherent trade-offs (using a sensitivity range of $S\\\_T$ from 1.0962 to 1.2116):

| Future Scenario | EUR Depreciates (e.g., S\_T=1.0962) | EUR Appreciates (e.g., S\_T=1.2116) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Unhedged** | Lowest Outcome ($21.92M) – Significant loss | Highest Outcome ($24.23M) – Full gain |
| **Forward / MM** | Fixed Outcome ($21.87M / $23.44M) – **Best protection** | Fixed Outcome – **Opportunity Cost** (misses upside) |
| **Put Option** | Payoff at Strike **(Floor)** ($22.87M) – Excellent protection | Payoff at Spot **(Upside)** ($24.04M) – Retains most upside |

| Strategy Attribute | Forward/MM | Put Option | Unhedged |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Certainty / Budgeting** | Perfect (Fixed Proceeds) | Guaranteed Floor | Zero |
| **Flexibility / Upside** | None (Caps Proceeds) | **Retains full upside potential** | Full |
| **Cost** | Zero (MM cost captured in rates) | Premium paid upfront (0.019 USD/EUR) | Zero |

### **D. Strategic Recommendation**

**Recommendation: Implement the Money Market (MM) Hedge.**

While the Put Option offers flexibility, the MM Hedge provides the highest guaranteed cash flow and eliminates all budget uncertainty.

### **E. Executive Justification**

#### **1\. Maximizing Certain Cash Flow**

The MM Hedge generates **$23,439,836**, which is **$1,569,836 (7.18%)** more than the Forward contract and **$573,836** above the Put Option's guaranteed floor. Given the high dollar value of the MM outcome, it is the most financially compelling choice for maximizing guaranteed returns.

#### **2\. Cash Flow Stability and Budget Certainty**

Both the Forward and MM hedges lock in a precise USD outcome. For a senior finance leader, the ability to forecast and budget with absolute certainty outweighs the desire for speculative upside, especially when the guaranteed amount is already superior.

#### **3\. Liquidity and Premium Costs**

Unlike the Put Option, which requires an upfront cash premium (EUR 20,000,000 $\\times$ 0.019 \= **$380,000**), the MM Hedge involves no initial out-of-pocket cost. The transaction is a cash-and-carry strategy where the interest differential is captured internally, improving immediate liquidity.

#### **4\. Risk Profile**

The MM Hedge effectively replicates the forward contract using domestic and foreign borrowing/lending rates. Its outcome is nearly risk-free, making it the most conservative and financially advantageous hedge available for this scenario.

**Conclusion:** The Money Market Hedge is the optimal strategy, offering the highest level of cash flow maximization and certainty, with superior results to both the market-quoted Forward Rate and the Put Option's minimum guarantee.
