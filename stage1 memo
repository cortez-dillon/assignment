## Executive Summary

Our firm faces a $20 million receivable in euros, due in one year. This exposure subjects our future USD proceeds to risk from EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuations. By strategically assessing FX risk and hedging alternatives, we aim to secure predictable outcomes and protect profit margins. Hedging methods—forward contracts, money market hedges, and options—can reduce uncertainty, though each carries trade-offs. Next, we will quantify projected scenarios and build a spreadsheet model to guide decision-making.

## Background & Objectives

Our upcoming foreign-currency receivable arises from sales to European clients, invoiced at €20 million and scheduled for payment in one year. FX transaction exposure is relevant: if the euro depreciates against the dollar, our actual USD receipts could be significantly less than anticipated, impacting profitability and forecasting.  
**Primary objective:** Stabilize expected USD proceeds and minimize adverse impacts from currency volatility.  
**Secondary goal:** Support financial planning accuracy and minimize execution costs.

## Methods

We will analyze the following three hedge families:

| Hedge Strategy        | Pros                                       | Cons                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Forward Contract     | Locks in fixed rate, simple execution       | No upside if EUR strengthens; rigid commitment    |
| Money Market Hedge   | Matches cash flow timing, flexible          | Requires borrowing access; interest rates matter  |
| FX Options           | Downside protection, upside potential       | Premium cost; more complex                       |

For decision-making, we will model USD outcomes under each scenario using current market rates and instrument costs. The Excel model will compare net USD receipts across hedge strategies, including premiums, forward rates, and theoretical unhedged proceeds.

## Limitations & Next Steps

> Assumptions include stable credit quality, reliable rate quotes, and no early payment risk. Volatility or macro shocks may alter effectiveness.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- Gather one-year EUR/USD spot, forward rates, and interest rates
- Build quantitative scenario model in Excel
- Analyze comparative net proceeds for each strategy

**Responsibility:** Treasury & Risk Team
