Executive Summary
Our firm faces a $20 million receivable in euros, due in one year. This exposure subjects our future USD proceeds to risk from EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuations. By strategically assessing FX risk and hedging alternatives, we aim to secure predictable outcomes and protect profit margins. Hedging methods—forward contracts, money market hedges, and options—can reduce uncertainty, though each carries trade-offs. Next, we will quantify projected scenarios and build a spreadsheet model to guide decision-making.

Background & Objectives
Our upcoming foreign-currency receivable arises from sales to European clients, invoiced at €20 million and scheduled for payment in one year. FX transaction exposure is relevant: if the euro depreciates against the dollar, our actual USD receipts could be significantly less than anticipated, impacting profitability and forecasting. The primary objective is to stabilize expected USD proceeds and minimize adverse impacts from currency volatility. Secondary goals include supporting accurate financial planning and minimizing execution costs.

Methods
We will analyze the following three hedge families:
Forward contract: Locks in a fixed exchange rate (e.g., 1.0935 EURUSD one-year forward) for USD proceeds.
  - Pros: Certainty on cash flows, simple execution.ebc​
  - Cons: No upside if EUR strengthens; commits the firm regardless of future needs.

Money market hedge: Uses borrowing/lending with spot and interest rates to synthetically fix the USD value.
  - Pros: Can be structured to match cash flow timing, flexible with short-term exposures.​
  - Cons: Requires access to borrowing and may not be optimal if interest differentials are unfavorable.
    
FX options (e.g., EUR put): Offers protection against euro depreciation while allowing upside if the euro appreciates.
  - Pros: Downside protection with upside potential.
  - Cons: Upfront premium cost ($0.019/contract), more complex and potentially higher expenses.

For decision-making, we will model USD outcomes under each scenario using actual market rates and instrument costs. The Excel model will compare net USD receipts across hedge strategies, factoring in premiums, forward rates, and theoretical unhedged proceeds.

Limitations & Next Steps:
Assumptions include stable credit quality, reliable rate quotes, and no early payment risk. Volatility or macro shocks may alter effectiveness.

Immediate Next Steps:
  - Gather one-year EUR/USD spot, forward rates, and interest rates.
  - Build Stage 2 quantitative scenario model in Excel.
  - Analyze comparative net proceeds for each strategy.
